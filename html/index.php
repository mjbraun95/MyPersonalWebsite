        Welcome to my website! I'm a third year Computer Engineering Co-op student, currently attending the University of Alberta. Currently I'm available for an 8 month work placement starting in January 2020, preferably doing software development. I've been learning a lot about web development lately. Along with this website, I have a couple of student groups which I have been doing some web development work on. If you would like references from me, or have any other questions, please let me know by email or by phone!
