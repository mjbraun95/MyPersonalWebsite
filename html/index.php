        Hey! Welcome to my website. <br><br>

        I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering Co-op student at the University of Alberta. <br>
        I'm currently available for an 8 month work term, starting in May 2022. <br><br>

        In the past, I worked for DevFacto as a Software Consultant. I did web development work for one of their largest clients, ASEBP. <br>
        I mostly did back end work on ASEBP's website using C#, .NET Framework, and SQL databases. I wrote and business rules and unit tests to calculate insurance eligibility, coverage, etc. for ASEBP's clients. I also did some front end work using React Framework and Typescript. During my time here, my team and I utilized agile software practices, such as SCRUM, daily sprints, daily stand-ups, daily meetings to consult with clients face-to-face, either in-person or over Teams. The team collaborated together using Azure DevOps and I would submit pull requests to production regularly. <br><br>

        Prior to that, I worked for Compugen, as an Deskside Support Technician. <br>
        I provided IT support for the Government of Alberta (Compugen's main client at the time). This involved network diagnostics, hard drive recovery, reimaging, diagnosing faulty hardware, drivers, etc. at several different Alberta Government offices in Edmonton during this time.
