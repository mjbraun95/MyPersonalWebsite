        <strong>Current Role: Project Manager – Crack Chaser Repair Solutions (Seasonal Role)</strong> <br>
        Since <strong>2015</strong>, I have worked seasonally at <strong>Crack Chaser Repair Solutions</strong>, a concrete and asphalt repair company. Since <strong>2019</strong>, I have been managing projects, leading crews of <strong>4-7 employees</strong>, and ensuring work is completed safely and efficiently. My role includes <strong>handling logistics, equipment maintenance, and project execution</strong>.<br><br>
        
        In addition to field operations, I <strong>developed and maintain the company’s website</strong> using <strong>PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, supporting its online presence and business operations. While I have enjoyed my time at Crack Chaser, I am now <strong>seeking long-term employment in IT support or technical operations</strong>, where I can apply my problem-solving skills and technical expertise in a fast-paced environment. <br><br>

        <strong>IT & Software Engineering Experience:</strong> <br>
        I previously worked as an <strong>Operations Engineering Student at AESO (Alberta Electric System Operator)</strong>. My role involved developing <strong>Python-based automation scripts</strong> for Alberta’s power grid simulations and optimizing a large-scale <strong>MS SQL database (100+ tables)</strong>. I also used <strong>Power BI and machine learning</strong> to analyze renewable energy trends and infrastructure performance. <br><br>

        At <strong>BC Hydro</strong>, I worked in a <strong>FIFO remote rotational role</strong> (<strong>14/14 and 21/7 schedules</strong>) at the <strong>Site C Hydroelectric Dam</strong>. I performed <strong>12-hour shifts in underground tunnels</strong>, ensuring structural concrete repairs were executed safely. The job required <strong>using two-way radio communication, operating heavy machinery (skid steers, boom lifts), and coordinating with large teams</strong>. <br><br>

        In <strong>Winter 2020</strong>, I worked as a <strong>Software Consultant at DevFacto</strong>, developing backend business logic using <strong>C#, .NET, and SQL databases</strong> for ASEBP’s insurance platform. I also gained experience with <strong>React, TypeScript, and Agile methodologies</strong> while working closely with clients. <br><br>

        My <strong>first IT role</strong> was at <strong>Compugen Inc.</strong> as a <strong>Worksite Support Technician</strong>, providing <strong>hardware and software troubleshooting</strong> for <strong>hundreds of Government of Alberta employees</strong>. I diagnosed <strong>networking issues, reimaged machines, configured Microsoft 365 accounts, and resolved security policy concerns</strong> across multiple office locations. <br><br>

        With my background in **IT support, software development, and hands-on operational work**, I am looking for a **long-term role** where I can **apply my technical expertise** and **grow within a company for multiple years**. My experience in **remote work environments, troubleshooting, and system administration** makes me adaptable to a variety of IT and operations roles. <br><br>
