        I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering Co-op student at the University of Alberta. Currently, I'm available for an 8 month work placement starting in May 2022. Along with this website, I've done web development for DevFacto as a Software Consultant, doing mostly backend work. Prior to that I was working at Compugen as a Deskside Support Technician doing contract work for the Government of Alberta.
