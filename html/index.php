        Hi! Welcome to my website. <br><br>

        I have a **BSc. in Computer Engineering** from the University of Alberta and a background in IT support, software development, and technical operations. I have experience working in **FIFO rotational roles**, remote environments, and hands-on technical troubleshooting. Currently, I am seeking a **long-term, full-time position in IT support or technical operations, ideally in a role that offers overtime and FIFO scheduling.**<br><br>

        **Current Role: Project Manager – Crack Chaser Repair Solutions (Seasonal Role)** <br>
        Since **2015**, I have worked seasonally at **Crack Chaser Repair Solutions**, a concrete and asphalt repair company. Since **2019**, I have been managing projects, leading crews of **3-5 employees**, and ensuring work is completed safely and efficiently. My role includes **handling logistics, equipment maintenance, and project execution**.<br><br>
        
        In addition to field operations, I **developed and maintain the company’s website** using **PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, supporting its online presence and business operations. While I have enjoyed my time at Crack Chaser, I am now **seeking long-term employment in IT support or technical operations, where I can gain deeper industry experience and grow within a company for multiple years.** <br><br>

        **IT & Software Engineering Experience:** <br>
        I previously worked as an **Operations Engineering Student at AESO (Alberta Electric System Operator)**. My role involved developing **Python-based automation scripts** for Alberta’s power grid simulations and optimizing a large-scale **MS SQL database (100+ tables)**. I also used **Power BI and machine learning** to analyze renewable energy trends and infrastructure performance. <br><br>

        At **BC Hydro**, I worked in a **FIFO remote rotational role** (**14/14 and 21/7 schedules**) at the **Site C Hydroelectric Dam**. I performed **12-hour shifts in underground tunnels**, ensuring structural concrete repairs were executed safely. The job required **using two-way radio communication, operating heavy machinery (skid steers, boom lifts), and coordinating with large teams**. <br><br>

        In **Winter 2020**, I worked as a **Software Consultant at DevFacto**, developing backend business logic using **C#, .NET, and SQL databases** for ASEBP’s insurance platform. I also gained experience with **React, TypeScript, and Agile methodologies** while working closely with clients. <br><br>

        My **first IT role** was at **Compugen Inc.** as a **Worksite Support Technician**, providing **hardware and software troubleshooting** for **hundreds of Government of Alberta employees**. I diagnosed **networking issues, reimaged machines, configured Microsoft 365 accounts, and resolved security policy concerns** across multiple office locations. <br><br>

        This combination of **IT support, software engineering, and hands-on operational experience** allows me to quickly **adapt to new environments, troubleshoot effectively, and work both independently and as part of a team**. **I am eager to secure a long-term IT position where I can contribute my technical expertise while gaining valuable industry experience over multiple years.** <br><br>
