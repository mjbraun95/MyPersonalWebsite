My website sucks. It looks unprofessional and doesn't look very nice. I'm not a web developer and I don't know what I'm doing really. I'm a computer engineering student and I want to spruce up my website. Help me make it look better.
Here's my code (not including CSS).

        Hey! Welcome to my website. <br><br>

        I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering Co-op student at the University of Alberta. <br>
        I'm currently available for an 8 month work term, starting in May 2022. <br><br>

        Last summer, I worked as a developer for a concrete & asphalt repair business. <br>
        I developed and hosted a website for the company as well as created SQL databases to manage their assets, clients, and contracts. I also wrote some Python programs to parse this data and found ways to save costs and increase the company's profits. <br><br>

        In winter of 2020, I worked for DevFacto as a Software Consultant.<br>
        I did web development work for one of their largest clients, ASEBP. I mostly did back end work on ASEBP's site using C#, .NET Framework, and SQL databases. I wrote business rules and unit tests to calculate insurance eligibility, coverage, etc. for ASEBP's clients. I also did some front end work using React Framework and Typescript. During my time there, my team and I utilized agile software development practices, such as SCRUM, daily sprints, daily stand-ups, daily meetings to consult with clients face-to-face, either in-person or over Teams. The team collaborated together using Azure DevOps and I would submit pull requests to production regularly. <br><br>

        Prior to that, I worked for Compugen in the summer of 2019, as an Deskside Support Technician. <br>
        I provided IT support for the Government of Alberta (Compugen's main client at the time). This involved network diagnostics, hard drive recovery, reimaging, diagnosing faulty hardware, drivers, etc. at several different Alberta Government offices. <br><br>

        In the summer of 2020, I worked for BC Hydro. I did construction work at the Site C Hydroelectric dam in Fort St. John, BC. I would work for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 2-4 weeks, then get flown back home for a week. I worked with a large team repairing widespread concrete damage within two massive underground water diversion tunnels, each tunnel 30 feet in diameter and over 1km in length. This job wasn't very relevant to my program, but I hope it highlights my great work ethic.

        Here's a list of some of my favourite projects I've worked on. This list is not extensive, I plan on adding more of my projects in the future!

<a name="3D_Printer"></a>
<h3 class="header">3D Printer</h3>
<div class="content">
    <p class="fullBox">
        This is a delta 3D printer I built from scratch. It is a little over 1 meter tall, and can print structures up to half of that height. It also has a printable base diameter of 25cm. The design is similar to the Kossel XL, however this is a custom build as all of the parts were ordered individually online. The printer can print with PLA and ABS plastic filament. On the right is a lion that I printed with it. It is run using Marlin firmware and an Atmel ATMega2560 microcontroller.

        <p style="margin: 0 auto; float: left">
            This project was made for a Hackathon. It's a program that grabs live Tweets from Twitter which have location data, using an API key. Then, it plots those locations onto a heat map across North America, refreshing every 5 seconds. The more red the area is, the more people are tweeting from that area.

        <p style="margin: 0 auto; float: left">
            This program generates a volume-frequency wave over time from any MP3/WAV file using the fast-fourier transform algorithm. It shows which frequencies (or notes) are playing, and how loud each note is playing, over the entire length of the MP3/WAV file. The program was made using the C++ library Qt, and the audio data was represented as a 2D, as well as a 3D moving bar graph over time.

        This is a music synthesizer. The interface was created using PyGame, and communicates with an Atmel ATMega2560 Microcontroller Board using C++, Arduino, and PySerial. The program can generate many different sound types, using combinations of different waveforms (sine, square, saw, etc.). You can make as many synth noises as you'd like, and compare them side-by-side. You can also hold down multiple keys at the same time to play chords.
    </p>
    <p class="fullBox" style="padding-bottom: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
        The synthesizer also includes features such as ADSR, LFO, and frequency range filtering.  
    </p>
    <p class="fullBox" style="padding-bottom: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
        ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) affects the volume of the note as you hold it over time.
    </p>
    <p class="fullBox" style="padding-bottom: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
        LFO (low frequency oscillator) creates a "wobbly" effect on the note, so as you hold the note down, the frequency moves up and down.

        This is a project I was working on this summer. It's a web scraping program which collects data from instituteforsupplymanagement.org, specifically PMI (Product Manufacturing Index) and NMI (Non-Manufacturing Index) Reports. These reports are uploaded monthly, and have information about which different parts of which goods and services industries are growing, and which parts are shrinking, relative to each other. Check out the report to find out more information about it! This program collects all that data, along with industry comments and the report date, and writes it into an Excel spreadsheet using requests, BeautifulSoup and openpyxl modules in Python. This is one part of a larger program I am making with a friend that aims to design a stock trading program.
