        Welcome to my website! I am a third year Computer Engineering Co-op student, currently attending the University of Alberta. I am looking for an 8 month work term placement starting in January 2020, preferably doing software development. Currently, I am working on developing a small android game. I've also been learning a lot about web development lately. Not only have I been putting time into this website, I'm also working on another one for a student group I'm in, Space Alberta Exploration Robotics. If you would like references from me, or have any other questions, please let me know by email or by phone!
